This study examined the effect of IFN-\u03b1 in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, and investigated the characteristics associated with treatment effect.METHODSWe searched MEDLINE, Scientific Citation Index, Current Content Connect, Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, and Chinese Biomedical Database, all up to 15 September 2009. We included randomized trials comparing IFN-\u03b1 to placebo, no treatment, or standard care (SC) in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Two reviewers assessed the risk of bias and extracted data, independently and in duplicate. We conducted meta-analyses of the included studies, and subgroup analyses to examine the association of pre-specified characteristics (eg, dose, treatment duration) with treatment effect.RESULTSA total of 31 randomized controlled trials, involving 2164 patients, were included. The risk of bias varied across studies. Compared with placebo, no treatment, or SC, IFN-\u03b1 improved loss of HBeAg (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.04), HBV DNA undetectability (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.32), HBeAg seroconversion (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.62), ALT normalization (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.56), and loss of HBsAg (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 4.91). Treatment effects differed in high versus low dose, and long versus short duration of IFN-\u03b1. The effect of high dose IFN-\u03b1 (OR 3.28, 95% CI 2.31 to 4.66) is statistically larger than that of low dose IFN-\u03b1 (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.28) on loss of HBeAg (interaction P = 0.017), and longer IFN-\u03b1 treatment durations produce greater effects (OR 3.28, 95% CI 2.16 to 5.00) than do shorter durations (OR 1.94, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.66, interaction P = 0.038). High dose IFN-\u03b1 had a significant effect on HBV DNA undetectability (OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.86), while low dose IFN-\u03b1 did not (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.41, interaction P = 0.01); longer treatments significantly improved HBV DNA undetectability (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.62 to 4.12), but shorter durations did not (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.97, interaction P = 0.024).CONCLUSIONSIFN-\u03b1 can improve serological, biomedical, and virological response.

Interestingly, diffusely distributed nuclear SUMO1 proteins were sequestered into ATBF1 dots, which could be related to ATBF1s physical association with PML NBs, known SUMOylation hotspots. Furthermore, ATBF1 itself was SUMOylated. ATBF1 SUMOylation occurred at more than 3 lysine residues including K2349, K2806 and K3258 and was nuclear specific.

LIF function is thought to be mediated by its binding to LIF receptor (LIFR) and recruitment of coreceptor GP130 (glycoprotein 130), and this receptor complex then activates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/3. However, the importance of LIFR and GP130 acting via STAT3 in implantation remains uncertain, because constitutive inactivation of Lifr, Gp130, or Stat3 shows embryonic lethality in mice. To address this issue, we generated mice with conditional deletion of uterine Gp130 or Stat3 and show that both GP130 and STAT3 are critical for uterine receptivity and implantation. Implantation failure in these deleted mice is associated with higher uterine estrogenic responses prior to the time of implantation. These heightened estrogenic responses are not due to changes in ovarian hormone levels or expression of their nuclear receptors. In the deleted mice, estrogen-responsive gene, Lactoferrin (Ltf), and Mucin 1 protein, were up-regulated in the uterus. In addition, progesterone-responsive genes, Hoxa10 and Indian hedgehog (Ihh), were markedly down-regulated in STAT3-inactivated uteri.

It is found that SampEn of EEG during AS is higher than that during QS. SampEn increases during both AS and QS before about 42 weeks in PMA while it ceases its increase in QS and even decreases in AS after newborns reaching term age. A distinct decrease in the interquartile range of SampEn is found with increasing PMA (from 25 to about 50 weeks), followed by maintenance of low fluctuation in SampEn curves.

The lower margin of the aEEG was positively correlated with PMA, with a larger rank correlation coefficient during quiet sleep (r = 0.89) than during active sleep (r = 0.49).CONCLUSIONSReference values of aEEG amplitudes were obtained for infants with a wide range of PMAs and constituted the basis for the quantitative assessment of aEEG changes with maturation in neonates and young infants.

To investigate the relationship between burst-suppression features and anesthetic concentration, we adopted four straightforward indexes, i. e., burst-suppression ratio (BSR), burst frequency, burst amplitude and suppression amplitude, and used them to analyze the EEG recordings in ten isoflurane-anesthetized rats. It was found that all the four burst-suppression indexes changed along with anesthetic concentration, that BSR and burst amplitude increased with higher concentration of isoflurane while burst frequency and suppression amplitude decreased, and that BSR was the most sensitive and consistent measurement to indicate isoflurane concentration so it constituted a valuable tool for timely evaluation of burst-suppression feature under deep anesthesia. The result also showed that the composition of carrier gas (i. e. pure oxygen vs. mixed oxygen) did not influence the effect of anesthesia significantly; and the four indexes of burst-suppression features could keep relatively stable within 60 min under the isoflurane concentration of 2%.

But most of these methods only analyze a few CpG sites in a target region. Indeed, difference of site-specific methylation may also lead to a change of methylation density in many cases, and it has been found that the density of methylation is more important than methylation of single CpG site for gene silencing.RESULTSWe have developed a novel approach for quantitative analysis of CpG methylation density on the basis of microarray-based hybridization and incorporation of Cy5-dCTP into the Cy3 labeled target DNA by using Taq DNA Polymerase on microarray. The quantification is achieved by measuring Cy5/Cy3 signal ratio which is proportional to methylation density. This methylation-sensitive technique, termed RMEAM (regional methylation elongation assay on microarray), provides several advantages over existing methods used for methylation analysis. It can determine an exact methylation density of the given region, and has potential of high throughput. We demonstrate a use of this method in determining the methylation density of the promoter region of the tumor-related gene MLH1, TERT and MGMT in colorectal carcinoma patients.CONCLUSIONThis technique allows for quantitative analysis of regional methylation density, which is the representative of all allelic methylation patterns in the sample.

It has been suggested that the effect of IL-1 might be post-transcriptional, exerted through the 5-untranslated region (5-UTR). To evaluate the role of IL-1 in CRP gene expression, we studied the effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) on both the endogenous CRP gene and on transfected CRP-CAT constructs in Hep3B cells. In kinetic studies of the endogenous CRP gene, IL-1 beta alone had no effect on CRP mRNA levels, but when added to IL-6, synergistically enhanced both CRP mRNA levels and transcription, as determined by Northern-blot analyses and nuclear run-on studies. IL-6 alone and the combination of [IL-1 beta + IL-6] each induced increases in mRNA levels roughly comparable with observed increases in transcription. These findings indicate that the effect of IL-1 beta on CRP expression is exerted largely at the transcriptional level in this system. This conclusion was confirmed by studies in Hep3B cells transiently transfected with CRP-CAT constructs, each containing 157 bp of the CRP 5-flanking region but differing in the length of the 5-UTR from 104 bp to 3 bp.

Here we report the characterization of a novel N-CoR-interacting protein, JMJD2A (previously known as KIAA0677). JMJD2A is an evolutionarily conserved nuclear protein containing many functionally unknown domains. JMJD2A directly interacts with the N-terminal region of N-CoR through a small NID (N-CoR interaction domain) both in vitro and in vivo. Despite its copurification with N-CoR, JMJD2A is not a core subunit of the stable multiprotein N-CoR complex and is not required for N-CoR-mediated repression by thyroid hormone receptor. By chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning, we identified the human achaete scute-like homologue 2 (ASCL2/Hash2) gene as a gene regulated by JMJD2A. ASCL2 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor whose mouse homolog is encoded by an imprinted gene highly expressed during the development of extraembroynic trophoblast lineages but repressed in other tissues and is essential for proper placental development. We demonstrated that JMJD2A selectively represses the expression of the ASCL2 gene but not other imprinted genes in the same imprinted locus in HeLa cells and that this repression required a functional N-CoR complex and the tandem Tudor domain of JMJD2A. Like N-CoR, JMJD2A is widely expressed in various mouse tissues.

Using the human erythroleukemic K562 cell line, which can be chemically induced to differentiate into either erythroid or megakaryocytic lineages depending on the inducers used, we have investigated the role of N-CoR in erythroid differentiation. We show that knockdown of N-CoR either transiently (siRNA) or permanently (shRNA) impairs the cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C)- but not hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. RT-PCR analysis reveals that N-CoR is required for induction by Ara-C of 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALA-S2), a key enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis. Furthermore, the amount of N-CoR proteins increases significantly during Ara-C-induced K562 differentiation, apparently through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Consistent with the data from N-CoR-null mice, N-CoR is not required for the differentiation of K562 cells into megakaryocytic lineages, induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

Inclusion of phosphatidylserine or dicetyl phosphate into liposomes with a simple composition of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol increases liposome clearance, while inclusion of GM1 or amphipathic poly(ethylene glycol) decreases the rate of liposome clearance. To understand the underlying mechanism by which liposome clearance is regulated by the RES, we have developed a simple liver perfusion system. Using mouse liver as a model, we demonstrated that hepatic uptake of neutral or negatively charged liposomes does not involve serum components. Liver uptake of liposomes is directly related to the surface characteristics of liposomes. Liposomes with a neutral composition of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol exhibit relatively low liver uptake. Inclusion of PS or DCP into these liposome dramatically enhances liposome uptake by the perfused liver. Conversely, inclusion of GM1 or PEG derivatives into liposomes greatly reduces the liposome uptake by the mouse liver.

The effect of different surfactants on the formation of DNA/emulsion complexes and transfection activity were analyzed using plasmid DNA containing luciferase cDNA as a reporter gene.RESULTSNon-ionic surfactants containing branched polyoxyethylene chains as the hydrophilic head group were more effective in preventing the formation of large DNA/emulsion complexes than those containing one or no polyoxyethylene chain.

Further, we studied up to 76 SNPs in a 400 kb region within and flanking the gene to evaluate the evidence that other genetic variants are associated with AD or cognitive function. There was no significant evidence for association between SORL1 SNPs and incident AD patients in the Rotterdam Study. In a meta-analysis of our data with those of others, six out of seven SNPs attained borderline significance. However, removal of the first study reporting association from the meta-analysis resulted in non-significant odds ratios for all SNPs. SNPs rs668387, rs689021, and rs641120 were associated with cognitive function in non-demented individuals at borderline statistical significance in two independent Dutch cohorts, but in the opposite direction. Testing for association using dense SNPs in the SORL1 gene did not reveal significant association with AD, or with cognitive function when adjusting for multiple testing.

We present a collapsed double heterozygosity (CDH) test to detect the presence of multiple LOF alleles at a gene.

The test is implemented for genome-wide analysis in the publically available software package GenABEL which is based on a sliding window approach. We provide the proof of principle by conducting a genome-wide CDH analysis of red hair color, a trait known to be influenced by multiple loss-of-function alleles, in a total of 7,732 Dutch individuals with hair color ascertained.

The present study examined an allelic variant of the ae(-) mutation, ae1.2, which expresses a catalytically inactive form of SBEIIb. The catalytically inactive SBEIIb in ae1.2 lacks a 28 amino acid peptide (Val272-Pro299) and is unable to bind to amylopectin. Analysis of starch from ae1.2 revealed altered granule morphology and physicochemical characteristics distinct from those of the ae1.1 mutant as well as the wild-type, including altered apparent amylose content and gelatinization properties. Starch from ae1.2 had fewer intermediate length glucan chains (degree of polymerization 16-20) than ae1.1. Biochemical analysis of ae1.2 showed that there were differences in the organization and assembly of protein complexes of starch biosynthetic enzymes in comparison with ae1.1 (and wild-type) amyloplasts, which were also reflected in the composition of starch granule-bound proteins. The formation of stromal protein complexes in the wild-type and ae1.2 was strongly enhanced by ATP, and broken by phosphatase treatment, indicating a role for protein phosphorylation in their assembly. Labelling experiments with [\u03b3-(32)P]ATP showed that the inactive form of SBEIIb in ae1.2 was phosphorylated, both in the monomeric form and in association with starch synthase isoforms. Although the inactive SBEIIb was unable to bind starch directly, it was strongly associated with the starch granule, reinforcing the conclusion that its presence in the granules is a result of physical association with other enzymes of starch synthesis. In addition, an Mn(2+)-based affinity ligand, specific for phosphoproteins, was used to show that the granule-bound forms of SBEIIb in the wild-type and ae1.2 were phosphorylated, as was the granule-bound form of SBEI found in ae1.2 starch.

As many researchers are focusing on more chronic endpoints in neuroprotection studies it is important to evaluate histological damage at later time points to ensure that standard methods of tissue injury measurement are accurate. To compare tissue viability at both acute and sub-acute time points, we used 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), Fluoro-Jade B, and NeuN staining to examine the evolving phases of infarction induced by a 90-min MCAO in mice. Stroke outcomes were examined at 1.5h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, and 7d after MCAO. There was a time-dependent increase in infarct volume from 1.5h to 24h in the cortex, followed by a plateau from 24h to 7d after stroke. Striatal infarcts were complete by 12h. Fluoro-Jade B staining peaked at 24h and was minimal by 7d.

Cell death in males is initiated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation; however, manipulation of this pathway paradoxically increases ischemic damage in females. In contrast, females are exquisitely sensitive to caspase-mediated cell death. The effect of caspase inhibition in PARP-1 knockout mice was evaluated to determine if the detrimental effects of PARP deletion in females were secondary to increased caspase activation.METHODSFocal stroke was induced by transient or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in wild-type (WT) and PARP-1(-/-) mice of both sexes. The pan-caspase inhibitor, quinoline-Val-Asp(Ome)-CH2-O-phenoxy (Q-VD-OPh), was administered 90 minutes after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct size and neurological sores were assessed. Separate cohorts were used for protein analysis for PAR, Apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), caspase-9, and caspase-3.RESULTSWT mice of both sexes had increased nuclear AIF after stroke compared to PARP-1(-/-) mice. PARP-1(-/-) females had higher mitochondrial cytochrome C and activated caspase-9 and -3 levels than WT female mice. PARP-1(-/-) females also had an increase in stroke-induced cytosolic cytochrome C release compared with WT females, which was not seen in males. Q-VD-OPh decreased caspase-9 in both males and females but only led to reduction of infarct in females. PARP-1(-/-) males had smaller infarcts, whereas PARP-1(-/-) females had larger strokes compared with WT. Q-VD-OPh significantly decreased infarct in both WT and PARP-1(-/-) females in both transient and permanent MCAO models, but had no effect in males.CONCLUSIONSDeletion of PARP-1 reduces infarct in males but exacerbates injury in females.

Clinical trials of ERT have demonstrated an increased risk of stroke in treated women, although the study participants were well past menopause when therapy was initiated. It has been suggested that detrimental effects of ERT may be unmasked after prolonged periods of hypoestrogenicity. To date, very few studies have examined the effect of ERT in aged animals, although the timing of replacement may be critical to the neuroprotective effects of ERT. We hypothesised that chronic ERT initiated in late middle age would decrease infarct size in the brain after an induced stroke, whereas acute ERT would have no beneficial effects in aged females. To test this hypothesis, two paradigms of ERT were administered to aged mice of both sexes aiming to determine the effects on stroke outcome and to explore the possible mechanisms by which ERT interacts with age. Female mice that received chronic ERT from 17-20\u2003months of age showed improved stroke outcomes after experimental stroke, whereas females that had acute ERT initiated at 20\u2003months of age did not. Chronic ERT females exhibited diminished levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) translocation compared to acute ERT females after stroke. Acute ERT females demonstrated both an increase in nuclear NF-\u03baB and enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, a sexual dimorphic effect of ERT was seen because males benefited from ERT, regardless of the timing of initiation. Aged males had significantly reduced expression of pro-inflammatory markers after stroke compared to age-matched females, suggesting a pro-inflammatory milieu emerges with age in females. These results are consistent with the emerging clinical literature suggesting that ERT should be initiated at the time of menopause to achieve beneficial effects.

In this paper, we investigated the changes of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in peripheral blood T lymphocytes and the effect of PKC on the peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis in ITP children. We demonstrated that T lymphocytes from ITP children were more susceptible to the activator (phorbol myristate acetate) and the inhibitor (H-7) of PKC. In ITP children, phorbol myristate acetate and H-7 dramatically affected T lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis, but altered little in healthy children. Compared with healthy children, PKC activity was significantly enhanced in ITP children, increasing the expressions of Fas ligand on CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, indicating positive correlations between PKC activity and the expressions of Fas ligand on T cells, while the relations between PKC activity and platelet count showed negative correlations. Taken together, our findings suggest that PKC signal transductions may participate in the procedure of T lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis in ITP children.

The structure relates to interactions between and within the DNA strands, and the array of other macromolecules that constitutes functional chromatin. It is only through its changing conformations that DNA can organize and structure a large number of cellular functions. In particular, DNA must locally uncoil, or melt, and become single-stranded for DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription to occur. It has previously been shown that this melting occurs cooperatively, whereby several base pairs act in concert to generate melting bubbles, and in this way constitute a domain that behaves as a unit with respect to local DNA single-strandedness. We have applied a melting map calculation to the complete human genome, which provides information about the propensities of forming local bubbles determined from the whole sequence, and present a first report on its basic features, the extent of cooperativity, and correlations to various physical and biological features of the human genome. Globally, the melting map covaries very strongly with GC content. Most importantly, however, cooperativity of DNA denaturation causes this correlation to be weaker at resolutions fewer than 500 bps.

As part of an ongoing large-scale cross-platform data comparison framework, we report here a comparison based on identical samples between one-dye DNA microarray platforms and MPSS (Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing).RESULTSThe DNA microarray platforms generally provided highly correlated data, while moderate correlations between microarrays and MPSS were obtained. Disagreements between the two types of technologies can be attributed to limitations inherent to both technologies. The variation found between pooled biological replicates underlines the importance of exercising caution in identification of differential expression, especially for the purposes of biomarker discovery.CONCLUSIONBased on different principles, hybridization-based and sequencing-based technologies should be considered complementary to each other, rather than competitive alternatives for measuring gene expression, and currently, both are important tools for transcriptome profiling.", "authors": ["F Liu", " TK Jenssen", " J Trimarchi", " C Punzo", " CL Cepko", " L Ohno-Machado", " E Hovig", " WP Kuo"], "publication_id": "17555589", "year": "2007-06-07", "keywords": "", "journal": "BMC genomics", "mesh_terms": "D000704:Analysis of Variance; D000818:Animals; D020869:Gene Expression Profiling; D015723:Gene Library; D051379:Mice; D008810:Mice, Inbred C57BL; D009693:Nucleic Acid Hybridization; D020411:Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; D017422:Sequence Analysis, DNA"}, {"title": "Effect of Chinese herbal treatment on Th1- and Th2-type cytokines, progesterone and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in early pregnant women of threatened abortion.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVETo study the clinical effects of Prescription Zhuyun-III (ZYIII) on early pregnant women diagnosed as threatened abortion, and its mechanism in immunity and endocrine by determining serum Th1- and Th2-type cytokines, progesterone, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG).METHODSThe treatment group comprised 30 early pregnant women diagnosed as threatened abortion of deficiency syndrome of Pi, Shen, or both. The control group consisted of 20 normal early pregnant women of similar gestational age. Patients in the treatment group were administered with ZYIII for 4 weeks. Peripheral blood samples were collected pre- and post-treatment from both the treatment and the control groups. Serum Th1-type cytokine [interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and Th2-type cytokine [interleukin-10 (IL-10)] were determined by flow cytometry, and serum progesterone and beta-HCG were determined by ELISA.RESULTS(1) The treatment was effective in 26 and ineffective in 4 patients of the treatment group. Therefore, the cure percentage was 86.67%. (2) In the treatment group before the treatment, IL-2 was significantly higher, IL-10 tended to be less, and the Th1/Th2 balance shifted toward Th1 compared with those in the control group.
