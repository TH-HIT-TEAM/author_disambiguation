    """Representation of a block.

    Block stores information about different variation of names and the
    quantities of their appearances on the papers.

    Example of a block _content:

    .. code:: python

        {
            ('JNS',): {
                ('P',): 2, ('P', 'PL'): 3, ('P', 'JH'): 2

                ('A',): 34
            }
        }

    From the example above, one can see that the block stores information
    about 5 signatures of 'JNS' 'SM0', 'PAL' 'JH'. Those strings are results
    of the phonetic algorithm. Such signature might correspond, for
    example, to Jones-Smith, Paul John.

    """Block the signatures.

    This blocking algorithm takes into consideration the cases, where
    author has more than one surname. Such a signature can be assigned
    to a block for the first author surname or the last one.

    The names are preprocessed by ``phonetic_tokenize_name`` function. As a
    result, here the algorithm operates on ``Double Metaphone`` tokens which
    are previously normalized.

    The algorithm has two phases. In the first phase, all the signatures with
    one surname are clustered together. Every different surname token creates
    a new block. In the second phase, the signatures
    with multiple surnames are compared with the blocks for the first and
    last surname.

    If the first surnames of author were already used as the last given names
    on some of the signatures, the new signature will be assigned to the block
    of the last surname.

    Otherwise, the signature will be assigned to the block of
    the first surname.

    To prevent creation of too big clusters, the ``threshold`` parameter can
    be set. The algorithm will split every block which size is bigger than
    ``threshold`` into smaller ones using given names initials as the
    condition.

    Parameters
    ----------
    :param X: numpy array
        Array of one element arrays of dictionaries. Each dictionary
        represents a signature. The algorithm needs ``author_name`` field in
        the dictionaries in order to work.
    :param threshold: integer
        Size above which the blocks will be split into smaller ones.
    :param phonetic algorithm: string
        Which phonetic algorithm will be used. Options:
        -  "double_metaphone"
        -  "nysiis" (only for Python 2)
        -  "soundex" (only for Python 2)
